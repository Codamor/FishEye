## What this project allowed me to practice

### Skills

* cut and integrate a model,
* structure a web page with HTML5,
* format a web page with CSS3,
* manipulate the DOM,
* listen to events,
* generate content dynamically from a JSON file,
* make the site accessible.

### Technologies / methods

* HTML5/CSS3,
* positioning with Grid and FlexBox,
* responsive design with media queries,
* BEM naming convention,
* Fetch/Json,
* CSS with Sass,
* WCAG 2.0.

## Expected deliverables

### Home page

* list of all photographers with their name, slogan, location,
  their price/hour, their tags and a thumbnail image of their choice,


* by clicking on a label (tag) in the navigation bar, the list of
  photographers is filtered to display only those who match this
  label,

* when the user clicks on a photographer's thumbnail, he is taken to his
  page.


### Photographers page

* displays a gallery of the photographer's work,


* photographers can show both photos and videos,

* each media includes the title, date, price and number of shots,
  * when the user clicks on the "Like" icon, it increments the number
    of likes displayed,
  * the total number of snaps should be counted and added to the profile total
    of the photographer,


* media can be sorted by popularity, date or title,


* when the user clicks on a media, it must open in a
  light box,


* display a button to contact the photographer
  * the contact form is a modal that is displayed over the
    rest,
  * it includes fields for names, email address and
    message,
  * later, the contact button will send a message to the photographer;
    For now, only display the contents of the three fields in
    the console logs
